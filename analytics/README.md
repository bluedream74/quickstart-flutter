# Google Analytics for Firebase Quickstart

This Firebase quickstart showcases how Firebase
Analytics can provide insight on app usage and user engagement. You can read more
about Google Analytics for Firebase [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics)!

## Getting Started

Google Analytics for Firebase offers multiple ways to understand how users are
engaging with your app. In this quickstart, we demonstrate how you can use
Google Analytics for Firebase to log in-app events and set user properties.

Ready? Let's get started! ðŸš€

Clone this project and `cd` into the `analytics` directory.
Run `flutter pub get`. This command will install all of the required dependencies
for this quickstart. Go ahead and
open the `analytics` folder in your favorite editor.

### Terminal commands to clone and open the project!
```terminal

git clone https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-flutter.git

cd analytics/

flutter pub get

flutterfire configure

flutter run
```

## Connecting to the Firebase Console

We will need to connect our quickstart with the
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com). For an in
depth explanation, you can read more about
[adding Firebase to your Flutter Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).

### Here's a summary of the steps!
1. Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
and create a new app.

2. Register this project with the Firebase console by calling `flutterfire configure`.

3. At this point, you can build and run the quickstart! ðŸŽ‰

## Interacting with the Quickstart

Google Analytics for Firebase is a great way to
[log user related events](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/events?platform=flutter)
or [set user properties](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/user-properties?platform=flutter).
This quickstart features a number of different UI controls that a user can interact with.
Depending on the control, Google Analytics for Firebase is used to either set a
user property or log an appropriate event.

## Viewing the analytics data

As you interact with the controls in the quickstart, analytics data will be sent to the
Firebase Console. To view and interact with this stream, navigate to the project you
set up for this quickstart on the Firebase Console. Select **Realtime** under the
**Analytics** on the vertical menu on the left. From here, you can interact with the
quickstart and see the related analytics data show up live on the Firebase Console.
